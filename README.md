Spreadsheets and Excel Macros

The Custom Functions add in is the code for some tools I wrote myself in Excel
The RegularExpressions custom function is based on code I found on stack exchange.
I made some changes, and rewrote it so It would get all the matches for a pattern, or just the first or last matches.
